   <h1>About</h1>
    <h3 style ="letter-spacing: 2px;">
We build what we want to ride.

We are passionate about materials, are committed to environmentally conscious design and production, appreciate the subtleties of process (the devil's in the details) and are devotees of functionally driven design.

The ideation and design of all of our products are spearheaded by a small, project specific, in-house team followed by input from the entire in-house crew and select ambassadors. The strength of each project team is built on a foundation of trust, maximizing individual strengths/perspectives, accountability, intellectual rigor and constructive criticism. Egos and biased assumptions are challenged and the expectation is that each player brings a healthy dose of positivity and passion to the table. The upshot is both refined product and poignant personal growth.</h3>
